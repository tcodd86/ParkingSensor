This is a project to be mounted on the wall of a garage to sens how close your car is to the wall when you park.

A PIR motion sensor is used to turn the distance meter and LED strip on and off.

Green LEDs light up as you approach, then yellow when you should park and red when you are too close to the wall.

The PIR motion sensor is optional and may be left out if you just want it on all of the time.
